### periodicity-research
##### The research of accuracy of searching cycles methods in symbolic sequences (time series) with presence of random noises.

## Official topic of the work:
# Research of Accuracy Cycles Identification Methods in Symbolic Sequences with Random Noises


### Pugacheva, Korotkov algorithm
Examples of Data files that was tested [on cluster](http://victoria.biengi.ac.ru/
- examples here 


###### instruction to test algorithms: 
- generate_data.py - customize and run the file
- test.py choose the test function and run it


If you wanna test Korotkov algortihms - see the cluster link
if you wanna test the STNR algorithm - ask about C# implementation

if you wanna test algorithm from existing package with FLOYD / BRENT / GOSPER / NIVASH - ask about the test program
that implemented on Java ( with nice GUI interface :-) )
